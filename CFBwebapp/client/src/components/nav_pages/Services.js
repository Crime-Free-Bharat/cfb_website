              Crime-free bharat generally means our country India should be completely crime-free. Our mother earth should have no cases of cybercrime nor any other crime as well. Cases should be reduced and proper legal actions should be taken. The legislation needs to be strict. Strong penal actions should come up and penalties must be imposed. 
              {/* Our Bharat will be crime Mukt or crime-free only when the cases will turn down to "0" from 1,00,000. This will surely take a lot of time. But we can all raise our voices and stand against crime. 
<br />Crime Free India‚Äù is a vision that should not be taken for its literal meaning of achieving zero crime. As said by Maithili Sharan Sir, there will always be some sort of violations but what he meant from this thing is that crime may occur but there must be a perceptible sense of security {'&'} safety.  */}

              Identity theft, child pornography, cyberbullying, cyber sex-trafficking, cyber-stalking, and cyber terrorism are some cybercrimes where most teenagers become a part of either voluntarily or by getting trapped.

              The major reason for falling prey to these crimes could be  emotions as they play a very important part in a teenager's life
